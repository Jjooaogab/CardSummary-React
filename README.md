## My process



### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://tailwindcss.com) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned that starting to make the application with Mobile first is easier when it comes to making the responsive one.
I also learned some Tailwind classes that I didn't know before this project.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<span className='underline underline-offset-1'>Check</span>
```
```

### Continued development

Have full mastery of Javascript, to be able to make more complex applications, in addition to improving the structure of project folders

## Acknowledgments

I was able to make the project completely from scratch and without consulting AI or related things ( Stackoverflow and others ) and I managed to make it responsive with tailwind for the first time.
